<h1>S2-CULTURE</h1>
<h5>
  Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
<p></p>

i have been on a situation where i have had the opiton weather to lie or tell the truth, i weighed up
my options by deciding how much one or the other would emotionly impact the person in question.
i lied. i shouldnt have, this person soon found out the truth and was angry i lied, i feel that if i was truthful
from the beginging this anger this person felt would have been drasticly smaller.
<p></p>

Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
<p></p>

Being a young brown boy can be tricky growing up in a predominantly white city has made me quite the contrarian,
and so im rebelious by nature and am constantly finding myself in subcultures that can tend to those needs like
alt music/graffiti/and other anti arts. also being born in 1997 automaticlly puts me into the world of the internet
weather i like it or not, so here i am.
<p></p>

Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
<p></p>

My strengths would have to be my creative opinions on all things and the tidyness of things.
My limitations would have to be social aspects of the work/school plcae like working with co-workers(i tend to get very insular) but when 
im working with customers this dosent seem to be the case.
<p></p>

Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
<p></p>

artistic creativeness i guess, this will help coming up with sexy origal ideas
<p></p>

Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
 Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
 <p></p>

 it again
