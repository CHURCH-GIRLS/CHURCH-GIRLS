        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        <p></p>

        soft skills / human skills are super important when it come to getting a job in any feild where you are working with others.
        <p></p>

        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer
        <p></p>

        NO!
