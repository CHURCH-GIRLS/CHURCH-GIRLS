    <h5>
    Classes are great for applying a broad set of css rules to mulitple elements a cross your page where as ids are for applying a more overruling rule set.
you can only apply one id per page but you can add as many classes to your page as you like. ids and classes also have a heirarchy type situation where the ids will overide any classes nested in around them. as you can see below ive used classes to quickly maniplate the bat textmojis, duplicating the class and making slight diferences to each class.<br> this to me seems like a just fine work flow.
