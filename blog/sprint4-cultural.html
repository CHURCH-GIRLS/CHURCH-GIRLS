    Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits peopleo -

Alot of people live under the impression that theyre brain builds are pre determand
and what you get is what your given. But neuroplasicity shows us that its never to
late to rewire and build on newly understood roads in our mind.

Repetetion and self belif would certainly be the main principals here that would
benefit me.

Discuss what it is and why it is relevant -

Groth mindset is the idea that a type of positive reinforcement done right can help
anyone learn and futher their understandings on something.

In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?

not really ive listened to alot of Micheal Gladwell and i feel like he touches
on both of these subjects quite well on his writtings.

How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?

using "not yet" or something like that as a sort of mantra for myself whenever
im feeling like i just cant do something.
