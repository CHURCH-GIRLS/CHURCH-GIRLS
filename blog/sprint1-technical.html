<h5> # My Reflections - Sprint One
In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:
# Command Line Primer
<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->
### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
The command line is a no nonsense, sensitive, and powerful tool. its very much like baking a cake,
just because you have all your ingrediants at hand dosent mean you can just conjure up a delicious cake, one must and the ingresiants
in the correct order or you will end up with trash.
### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
nope i did not stick to the timeline. next time i will not leave the house half way through a project. next time ill do it 100% before i go anywhere.
### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do
ls (the ls command displays everything in your directory)
cd (cd is the command for changing directorys)
cd ..(this will make you jump back one pace in the directory)
git commit (this will kinda save a copy of your work from gitbash on to github) honestly im unsure of what it really does.
touch (touch will create a file wherever you are in your directory)
# Install and Explore Git
<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->
### Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
git is a desktop command line application/tool where as Github is an web based file host where devolpervers from all over share and download projects. (hentai).
### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
git is the physicall human boday and github is the spiritual plane that we all co exits on.
### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
? i feel like i should of remembered all the comands from yours video and the above links by now,
but as you said in the video its 2020 baby just google it.
### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
 maybe taken physical notes while learning the initial git command puerly because i absorb my info that way.
# Branch, Pull, Merge
<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->
### What is Master?
Master is your main body of work, the central respotory, its is the master branch
### Why create a Branch?
while collaborating with other people on a single project its easy to see how messy your projects could get if everyone was working on the same branch, so you create your own stem/branch so you can work without
convoluting the main project.
### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
after working on a body of work you will want to "Stage" it, take a step back admire the work you have done, check for bugs make sure everything is in its
right place before you save it or "Commit" it. now its commited it will act like a checkpoint in your work where you can fall back on if need be.
# GitHub Fork & Clone
<!-- Answer the following questions -->
### What are some examples of when you would fork?
when wanting to keep your main body work well preserved but also letting verious collaboratours edit their own forked copy of the master source
### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
its not magic. when i g
# Setup Repo & Create Blog

# Introduce yourself
Kia Ora yall im Niko. i reside in a warm and cosy flat in the Banks Peninsula. My mother and all my younger siblings (5 in total) live just around the hill, where as my older brother lives up in Auckland, i love them all. i suck at writing. at heart im a creative but the idea on selling my "art" kinda makes me sick. i love music movies and cooking more than Kanye loves Kanye. ive been in hospo for about a decade and ive had enough! So here i am hi Dev academy 2020.
 i am an absolute homebody so naturally i have an affinity for computers and the internet, i feel obliged to understand them on a deeper level so i can use these things to express myself because the English language kinda sucks and dosent do me much justice. also money, i want job ya know.
I dont think very highly of myself but the people who are close to me tell me that im a  chaotic/kind/proud/loud/spicy/contrarian, i cant really argue that. When it come to values im pretty basic, FREEDOM AND EQUALITY for all. :heart:.. thank you for listening and letting me be myself.
### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?
not nice its really tricky to have to find my own identity for the sake of others
### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?
hahahahhahaha yes and yes.
